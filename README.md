**This light-weight sound library** is just a copy of [another repository containing a full library of sound files](https://github.com/Xon77/L4LSoundsDataBase), where several sound folders have been deleted. It is here just to test quickly the [Live 4 Life project](https://github.com/Xon77/Live4Life), and also for Windows and Linux users, beacause loading lots of sound buffers on these specific is very slow. Do not ask me why? I have no idea.
